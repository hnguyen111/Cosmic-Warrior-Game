# Cosmic Warrior Game

The game features a spaceship, as well as numerous asteroids floating around within the game map. This map is unbounded, that is, objects that travel off the screen edge immediately reappear on the opposite side.

There is a bot developed using an algorithm to shoot asteroids with the ship's cannons and score points before running out of fuel.

Note that the player earns more points for destroying smaller asteroids and loses points if their spaceship collides with an asteroid.
